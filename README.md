# Titanic_survival

This repository contains code for developing a machine learning model to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic. The project was created as part of the Kaggle competition "Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster" and it scored among top 18 % of participants. The code includes exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation steps, providing a comprehensive approach to solving this classic binary classification problem.
